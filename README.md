# iOS-Test

## Objective
We would like to have you complete the following code test so we can evaluate your iOS skills. 
Please fork this repository and when you finish, create a Pull Request.  

Your assignment is to create a simple Reddit client that shows the top 50 entries from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/top)


## What to do
Create a specific iOS App containing two screens:

1. First screen: use [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api) to list the top 50 entries
- Show: Title, author, thumbnail, number of comments, entry date (following a format like “x hours ago”) 

2. Second screen: details of selected entry from the list
- Feel free to show anything you want about the entry


## Guidelines
To do this please follow these guidelines:

    - Assume the latest platform and use Swift
    - Use MVVM pattern
    - Use Coordinator pattern
    - Use UITableView / UICollectionView to arrange the data
    - Use cocoapods as dependency manager 
    - Support all iPhone screen sizes
    - Use Storyboards/Xibs
    - Create unit tests
    - Add Pull to Refresh on the list
    - Add Pagination support on the list
    - Create your own UI
